<p>This website will simplify the ordering process between a restaurant and its customers. 
  It allows customers to create groups (they will become the organiser of that group) and invite other customers.
  Customers can submit their orders to the organisers and how much they will pay, and the organisers will authenticate
  these orders and collect outsanding payments later. To create a new group, click on the "Create Group" button on the
  orderer's side navigation bar. To join an existing group, you must be invited or get an invite code from an organisertyt. 
  If you are a restaurant manager or chef, you are able to view the orders made by customers once you log in. 
  Here, you can view the orders that need to be completed as a list, as well as useful data visualisations
  about the orders made within the past couple of weeks. This allows you to gain an understanding about which
  food items are popular and also see the number of sales you got. To create a group order, everyone in the 
  group must select the food items they want (on what page??), and the group leader authenticates the order.
